Kicad projects and other files for lightsaber soundboard hardware.

## Caveat Emptor
NO WARRANTY IS AVAILABLE, EXPRESSLY STATED, OR IMPLIED.

These designs and files are not guaranteed to have been reviewed by a professional
engineer. They are not guaranteed to work in your design. They are not even 
guaranteed to work if sent to a PCB manufacturer. The author(s) cannot be held
liable for any injuries or damage that occurs as a result of using these files. It
is your responsibility to review all designs and files carefully before using them 
or integrating them into your own design.

Let the buyer beware.

## Structure
Each subfolder represents a different kicad project, each attempting a different board, 
either in terms of features or formfactor.

## Software versions
I use the latest kicad version from flatpak. If you can't open a project, feel free to 
file an issue, but there's a limit to how much support I can provide.

## 3rd Part Services
Preferred PCB manufacturers include JLCBCP, OSH Park, and PCBWay, but any given project 
won't necessarily support all 3 manufacturers. Preferred distributors include Digikey,
Mouser, and LCSC. Same caveat with preferred PCB Manufacturers applies to distributors.
